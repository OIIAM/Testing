# Background

Background about Twice. Twice is a 9 member girl group, debuted on October 20th 2015, with their first EP (Extended Play something with more tracks compared to a Single and less compared to an Album) The Story Begins with their lead single being, Like Ooh Ahh. The formation of the group happened through a competition survival show called Sixteen. It was named Sixteen as there were sixteen competitors. Eventually, the group was formed with 7 members, Jihyo, Jeongyeon, Nayeon, Chaeyoung, Mina, Sana, Dahyun and 2 more, Tzutu and Momo were added by Park Jin-young, the CEO of JYPE one of the big 3 KPOP entertainment agency.

## Reasons for using Twice as assignment

I decided to do my assignment based on Twice as I fell in love with their music back in 2017 when my classmate introduced me to their newest song at that time, Signal. The song got me hooked to the group up till now 2022.

## Who the site is made for

The website is mainly made for newer Twice fans that wants to know a little more about their new interest girl group. This website allows them to not only see who each members are, being able to get their official solo and group Instagram handles without taking abit of time to filter througn all the fan insta pages that have been set up by their lovely fans. The website also aims to help newer fans in figuring out how many korean singles Twice have so far and by descending order.

The Website also caters for returning fans, who stopped listening to Twice for a while, and is curious about how many songs the Girl Group have released so far.
